## 🎯 Key Narratives for PTM

### Success Story: Ryan Tan
"Ryan has shown remarkable growth this term. While he faced significant behavioral challenges in September and October, the coordinated support from our CMT team, family support services, and consistent positive reinforcement has resulted in a complete turnaround. He's now helping his peers, his grades have recovered dramatically, and his mother reports improved behavior at home as well. This is exactly the kind of progress we hope to see when families and school work together."

### Ongoing Support: Eric Lim
"Eric continues to require our support through the SWAN programme. We're working closely with his family and our counseling team to address the anxiety and social challenges he's facing. While his academic performance has been affected, we're seeing positive engagement in his counseling sessions, and we're committed to providing the comprehensive support he needs during this difficult time."

### Excellence: Alice Wong & Muhammad Iskandar
"Both students continue to excel across all subjects and demonstrate leadership qualities. We're exploring opportunities for them to mentor peers and take on additional enrichment activities."
