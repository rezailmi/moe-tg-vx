/**
 * Query Keys Factory
 *
 * Centralized query key management for TanStack Query.
 * Follows best practices from TanStack Query docs.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Type-safe query keys
 * - Consistent naming across the app
 * - Easy cache invalidation (invalidate all students, specific student, etc.)
 * - Prevents key collisions
 *
 * @see https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/query-keys
