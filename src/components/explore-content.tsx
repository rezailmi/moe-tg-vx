The registration exercise is conducted annually from July to August over five distinct phases (Phase 1, 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2C Supplementary), with each phase catering to different priority groups based on factors like sibling relationships, parent involvement with schools, and proximity to residence.

The portal allows parents to view their child's eligible phases and schools, submit registrations online without physically queuing at schools, and check registration results digitally. For the 2025 exercise starting July 1st, the portal handles tens of thousands of registrations nationwide. The system is designed to be user-friendly, accessible, and transparent, providing parents with clear information about eligibility, vacancies, and registration outcomes.`,

MOE progressively transitioned all 360 schools to the new and improved SSOE 2.0 from August 2017 to December 2018, bringing MOE's ICT infrastructure to the next level to better support teaching and learning needs.

The SSOE 2.0 rollout linked more than 100,000 devices across 344 schools and can provide connectivity for up to 500,000 devices—from desktops and laptops to mobile devices—in an environment of better and faster overall network performance. Multi-tiered firewalls and a network monitoring and management system for cyber threats have been built into SSOE 2.0 to enhance ICT security.

A major innovation introduced with SSOE 2.0 was the automation of delivery of systems to schools, reducing the turnaround time for school infrastructure deployment (servers and virtual machines) from 4 days to just 1 day. The system includes secure features for e-assessments, with ITD Lockdown accounts recommended for subjects with National e-Examinations. In 2022, MOE announced a 3-year extension of the SSOE 2.0 programme, with plans for SSOE 3.0 currently in development.`,

The platform integrates seamlessly with Google Classroom, allowing teachers to leverage built-in chat and comment features to leave students feedback as they're working on assignments. Schools need to ensure proper monitoring and security measures are in place to maintain Google Chat as a safe space for students and teachers to collaborate and communicate in real-time every day.`,

Educators use Gemini to kickstart lesson planning, brainstorm and research new ideas, quickly draft lesson plans aligned to learning objectives and education standards, and get fresh ideas for ways to make lessons more engaging.

In the coming months, educators will be able to assign Gems (custom AI assistants) and notebooks from NotebookLM grounded in their class materials directly to students in Google Classroom. Gemini's new Guided Learning mode helps students understand concepts with step-by-step support rather than just providing answers, promoting deeper learning and critical thinking. Google has partnered with learning science experts, tested with youth advisory panels, and added extra data protection for all education users, ensuring that data from chats will not be used to improve AI models.`,
