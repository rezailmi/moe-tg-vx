## 🔍 Quick Reference

### For Planning a New Feature
1. Start with **Plan** folder to see current priorities and roadmap
2. Check **Tasks** folder for similar feature implementation plans
3. Review **System** documentation to understand current architecture
4. Follow **SOP** for standard procedures

### For Understanding the System
1. Start with **System/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** for overall architecture
2. Check **System** folder for specific subsystem documentation
3. Review **Tasks** folder for feature-specific details

2. Refer to **System** documentation for context
3. Look at **Archive** for examples of completed work

## 📝 Important Rules

1. **Always update** `.agent` docs after implementing features to ensure up-to-date information
2. **Always read** `.agent/README.md` (this file) before planning any implementation to get context
3. Keep documentation organized in the appropriate folders
4. Archive completed work summaries to keep active documentation clean
